# Recipe Discovery App
This is an application built using **React**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This is bulit using TheMealDB API.  The application will allow users to browse recipes by category, search for specific recipes, view detailed recipe information, and manage a personal list of “favorite” recipes.

## Objective
- Implement state management, Custom Hooks, Global State with Context API, Data fetching and Routing
- Build components that render recipes in a home page, Filter Categories, provide funtionality to maintain a favrites list
- Provide search functionality.

# Your users should be able to:
- See/Browse all the recipes available
- Let users navigate to a specific category from home page and view recipes by category
- Let users to navigate to a particular recipe detail page from a category page
- Add a recipe to its favorite list/page, remove a recipe from favorite list
- Search for a recipe based on recipe name

## Reflection:
#### The most Challenging Part:
- One of the most challenging aspects was implementing custom hooks and properly configuring the Context Provider — particularly wrapping the app's children with the FavoriteContext so the state could be accessed globally.
- I created reusable hooks like useFetch and useLocalStorage to avoid repeating state and effect logic, especially since API calls and local storage interactions occurred in multiple components. This helped keep the code clean, modular, and easy to test.
- Designing the routing and navigation flow also required careful planning. Since the app’s core features were clearly defined, I structured the pages and routes to follow a logical and intuitive user journey — from the homepage to category browsing, detailed recipe views, search, and favorites.
